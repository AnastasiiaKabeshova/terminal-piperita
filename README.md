terminal-piperita
=================

The "Piperita" theme for the OS X application Terminal, based on [Peppermint](http://noahfrederick.com/blog/2011/lion-terminal-theme-peppermint/) by [Noah Frederick](http://noahfrederick.com/).

Installation
------------

Clone the repository or download the zip to your OS X machine. Double-click Piperita.terminal to install the theme in the terminal application. 

Optionally: You can copy the contents of .profile to your .profile or copy the whole thing if you don't have a .profile. The easiest way to do this is to navigate to where you downloaded the repo in Terminal and run

```bash
cat .profile >> ~/.profile
```

This will append your .profile if it exists or create it if it doesn't.
